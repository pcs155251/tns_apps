# TNS algorithms
## Introduction
This is a collection of TNS algorithms, including:

* computation of environment of 2D tensor network with translational invariance:
 * Corner transfer matrix (CTM) for iPEPS and 3-PESS.
 * CTM with dimension reduction technique for 3-PESS.
 * Channel environment.
* optimization method: 
 * Simple update for iPEPS and PESS. 
 * Full update for iPEPS.
 * Variational update for iPEPS (under development).
* auxiliary TNS functions
 
Where iPEPS is defined on square lattice and 3-PESS is defined on kagome lattice.
\section Usage
- Requirement
 + uni10 v2.1.0: https://gitlab.com/uni10/uni10
- Executable: 
Below directories include main function and corresponding input parameters which can be compiled and execute.
The dependency is handled by Makefile in each directory. 
To build the executable, just type `make`.
 + channel: Compute channel environment for 2D transverse Ising model.
 + ipeps: Simple update and full update with CTM environment for transverse Ising model.
 + pess: Simple update and CTM, CTM with dimension reduction scheme for Heisenberg model with DM interations.
- Input Files: 
In the directories with executable, there is corresponding *.rc file where input parameters are set.
For the meaning of each parameters, please refer to class `paraIpeps` and `paraPess`.
- Output Files:
 + The data will stored in data/ automatically
 + The tensors will stored in OutputT/ automatically
- Auxiliary TNS functions:
 + tools/ some useful functions.
 + nsy_ham/ hamiltonians.
 + nsy_op/ operators.
- One can create its own main function based on the class and method which have been implemented.
